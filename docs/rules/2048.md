Slide the tiles to combine matching numbers. Reach **2048** to win!

## How to Merge
When two tiles with the same number touch, they become one bigger number!

<div class="flex items-center justify-center gap-4 bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-3xl"><div class="w-12 h-12 bg-amber-100 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center text-xl font-bold text-slate-700 shadow-sm">2</div><span class="text-2xl text-slate-400">+</span><div class="w-12 h-12 bg-amber-100 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center text-xl font-bold text-slate-700 shadow-sm">2</div><span class="text-2xl text-slate-400">=</span><div class="w-14 h-14 bg-orange-300 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center text-2xl font-bold text-white shadow-md animate-bounce">4</div></div>

## Rules
*   **Swipe**: Swipe Up, Down, Left, or Right to move ALL tiles.
*   **New Tiles**: Every time you move, a new '2' or '4' appears.
*   **Don't Get Stuck**: If the board fills up and you can't merge anything, it's Game Over!

## Pro Tip
**Keep the big one in the corner.** Try to build your biggest number in the bottom-right corner and don't move it!
